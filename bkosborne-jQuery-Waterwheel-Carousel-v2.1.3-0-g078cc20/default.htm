<h2>About</h2>

<p>I use a variety of hand-selected gemstones, ranging from pink sapphires to crazy lace agate, as the focus of my work. On occasion, I have also found an inspiring and truly unique vintage component.  I sometimes include Swarovski crystals as accent pieces. Sterling silver is by far my favorite metal to work with because of its luster and versatility, though I will also use gold-filled if a piece demands it.   The main techniques I use are wirework, soldering, metal-forming, and stringing to achieve my vision for each stone.</p>

<p>I see gemstones as unfinished natural works of art, and I design pieces that form a cohesive whole centered around the stone(s). Thus, I create pieces that are extensions of the stone(s) instead of using stones to accent my design.  Because I love trying new things and work with materials that are inherently unique, nearly all of my jewelry is one-of-a-kind. </p>

<p>I also pay a great deal of attention to detail.  I spend hours painstakingly matching pairs of gemstones, and then wrapping them into earrings that match so perfectly it is nearly impossible to tell the two apart.  I also spend a lot of time creating sets of gemstones that harmonize for pieces that contain multiple stones.   Proper matching, whether for pairs or groupings, adds that subtle something that takes stones from beautiful to stunning. </p>
